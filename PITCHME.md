## Why TypeScript?

Future of JavaScript, Today  
Better Tooling  
It's JavaScript That Scales

## Best Thing about TypeScript

> It doesn't try to not be JavaScript - it just tries to make JavaScript better

## What TypeScript Isn't

> **TypeScript is manifestly not about turning JavaScript into C#.** Youâ€™ll never be best of breed in one ecosystem by attempting to retrofit another ecosystem.

## Everyone Talks About

classes  
arrow functions  
basic type usage

These are great reasons to use TypeScript

Equally good - TypeScript's awesome type system

---

## Let's Dive In

---

## Let's Talk Basics

`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `array`  
`null`, `undefined`  
`any`

---

## Implicit Types

Variables and functions will be given types by TypeScript where possible

```typescript
let aNumber = 42;   //aNumber is inferred to be type 'number'
```

If you mix types, TypeScript will show an error

```typescript
let aNumber = 42;
aNumber = "forty two";  //Error: aNumber is of type number
```

---

## Explicit Types

You can add type annotations to your variables

```typescript
let aNumber: number = 42;
```

Explicitly marks variable as a type  
Useful when you don't know value ahead of time

---

## Functions

In JavaScript, it's a free-for-all

```typescript
function printNameAndAge(name, age) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
    console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
}

printNameAndAge("Spencer", 30);
printNameAndAge();  //totally valid
printNameAndAge("Jeff", "Jon", "Jay", "old");
```

---

## Functions

In TypeScript, it's better enforced

```typescript
function printNameAndAge(name: string, age: number) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
    console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
}

printNameAndAge("Spencer", 30); //ok
printNameAndAge();  //error: need 2 parameters
printNameAndAge("Jeff", "Jon", "Jay", "old");   //nope
```
