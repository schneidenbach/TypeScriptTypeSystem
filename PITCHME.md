## What TypeScript Isn't

> **TypeScript is manifestly not about turning JavaScript into C#.** Youâ€™ll never be best of breed in one ecosystem by attempting to retrofit another ecosystem.

Equally good - TypeScript's awesome type system

## Let's Dive In

## Let's Talk Basics

`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `array`  
`null`, `undefined`  
`any`

---

## Implicit Types

Variables and functions will be given types by TypeScript where possible

```typescript
let aNumber = 42;   //aNumber is inferred to be type 'number'
```

If you mix types, TypeScript will show an error

```typescript
let aNumber = 42;       //aNumber is inferred to be of type 'number'
aNumber = "forty two";  //Error: aNumber is of type number
```
